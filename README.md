A Hangman game created with C is a simple console-based game where the player guesses letters to figure out a hidden word. The game starts by selecting a random word, and the player has a limited number of incorrect guesses to figure it out. Each incorrect guess adds a part to the hangman figure, and the game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

The game displays the word with underscores representing the unguessed letters and updates the word with the correctly guessed letters. It also keeps track of the incorrect guesses and remaining attempts. After each round, the game offers the option to play again.

The app is simple yet engaging, providing an interactive way to test vocabulary and memory. It stores the list of words in an array or file for random selection, and the game runs in a text-based interface, making it lightweight and fun to play.
